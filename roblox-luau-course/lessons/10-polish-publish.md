# 10 — Polish, Testing, Publishing, Monetization Basics (30–45 min)

Goal: Add shine, test with multiple players, publish your game, and understand basic monetization options.

## 1) Polish
- Materials, colors, lighting (Sky, Bloom, ColorCorrection)
- Sounds: add `Sound` objects to parts or `SoundService`
- UI: clean fonts, spacing, alignment

## 2) Testing
- Test → Local Server → 2 Players (spawns multiple clients)
- Verify remotes, leaderstats, and UI work for all players

## 3) Publishing
- File → Publish to Roblox As...
- Set Game Icon and Thumbnails (create in an image editor)
- Configure Permissions (public/private) and access

## 4) Monetization (basics)
- Developer Products (one-time purchases) vs Game Passes (ownable perks)
- Keep it fair: no pay-to-win in competitive modes
- Start small: one product that saves time or adds fun

## 5) Checklist
- [ ] Clear goal and instructions for the player
- [ ] No obvious bugs in Output
- [ ] Mobile controls usable
- [ ] Thumbnail and icon look appealing

Congrats — you can now build and ship playable Roblox games.
