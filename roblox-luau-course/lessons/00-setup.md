# 00 — Setup Roblox Studio (10–15 min)

Goal: Install Roblox Studio, sign in, set a clean layout, and learn the three panels you’ll use 90% of the time.

## 1) Install and sign in
- Install Roblox Player and Roblox Studio from your account
- Open Roblox Studio, sign in

## 2) Clean layout you’ll actually use
- View → enable: Explorer, Properties, Output
- File → Studio Settings → Script Editor → enable line numbers, word wrap
- File → Game Settings → turn on Studio access to API Services (later for DataStore)

## 3) Create your first place
- New → Baseplate
- Save to file and name it: `practice-place.rbxlx`

## 4) Learn the panels
- **Explorer**: tree of everything in your game
- **Properties**: selected item’s settings
- **Output**: where prints and errors appear (View → Output)

## 5) Safety & habits
- Use Play Solo (▶) to test; Stop to exit
- Save often; use incremental filenames: `practice-place-001.rbxlx`
- Read errors out loud; they tell you what to fix
